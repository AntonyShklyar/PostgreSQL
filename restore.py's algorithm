The algorithm of the database recovery script
------------------------------------------------------
Changeable parameters:
--codid
The data type is a dictionary.
Data - Data Center ID: Data Center Name
--codename
The data type is a dictionary.
Data - data center name: list of IP addresses of data center storages
--domain
The data type is a dictionary.
Data - domain: list of IP addresses of domain stores
--vipcluster
The data type is a dictionary.
Data - virtual IP address of the cluster master node: list of servers included in the cluster

Script algorithm
The algorithm of the “restore.py” script:
1.	check for the existence of the backupdb.log log file. If not, create a file. File size check. If the size equal to 1 GB is reached, the file is cleared;
2.	checking network availability via ICMP protocol of servers with backup storages;
3.	determination of available IP addresses of servers with backup storages and segments/data centers in which they are located;
4.	checking the availability of backup storages via the SMB protocol. Mounting a network resource if the share is not mounted;
5.	determination of mount points of available storages;
6.	checking the presence of a reserved server in the dictionary of servers included in database clusters;
7.	if the server is part of a database cluster, the virtual IP address of the cluster is determined;
8.	prompting the user to start the recovery procedure;
9.	if the server is part of the database cluster, the status of the corosync and pacemaker services is checked, as well as the presence of a process that starts the database;
10.	if the server is part of a database cluster, it is restored - database replication from the master node. In the event of a cluster crash, the cluster is restored manually;
11.	if the server is not part of the database cluster, the available repositories and the copies that are in them will be shown;
12.	prompting the user for a backup name in accordance with the format;
13.	restoring the database from a backup.
