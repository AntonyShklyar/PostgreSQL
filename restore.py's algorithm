The algorithm of the restore.py script:
1. check for the existence of the backupdb.log log file. If not, create a file. File size check. If the size equal to 1 GB is reached, the file is cleared;
2. checking network availability via ICMP protocol of servers with backup storages;
3. determination of available IP addresses of servers with backup storages and segments/data centers in which they are located;
4. Checking the availability of backup storages via the SMB protocol. Mounting a network resource if the share is not mounted;
5. determination of mount points of available storages;
6. checking the presence of a reserved server in the dictionary of servers included in database clusters;
7. if the server is part of a database cluster, the virtual IP address of the cluster is determined;
8. prompting the user to start the backup procedure;
9. if the server is part of a database cluster, it is restored - database replication from the master node. In the event of a cluster crash, the cluster is restored manually;
10. if the server is not part of the database cluster, the available repositories and the copies that are in them will be shown;
11. prompting the user for a backup name in accordance with the format;
12. restoring the database from a backup.
